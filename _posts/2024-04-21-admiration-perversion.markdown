excerpt: "Exploring the fine line between admiration and objectification in the context of bralessness."
---

As a man writing about women's choices to go braless, I tread a fine line—one that oscillates between admiration for a woman's autonomy over her body and the societal perversion that often shadows such personal decisions. It's a complex space where perceptions are as varied as they are volatile.

When a woman chooses to go braless, it's often seen as a bold statement of comfort and confidence—a declaration of her right to own her body. From a man's perspective, this should be met with respect and admiration. However, societal conditioning sometimes blurs these lines, introducing an unwelcome sexualization of what is essentially a personal comfort choice.

Admiration stems from respect. It's about appreciating someone's courage to defy societal norms and embrace their natural form without shame or fear. This admiration is for the person's confidence and the subtle act of rebellion against conventional beauty standards. It is about supporting a movement that encourages comfort over conformity, health over discomfort.

On the flip side, there is a small but vocal segment of society that views bralessness through a lens tainted with sexual connotations. Here lies the perversion—a reduction of a woman's choice to mere sexual objectification. It's a perspective steeped in outdated views where a woman’s body is still a public commodity.

Discussing bralessness in public spaces opens up broader conversations about body autonomy and the male gaze. It's crucial to acknowledge that while admiration for someone's lifestyle choice is healthy, reducing that choice to sexual aspects strips away the empowerment it is meant to symbolize.

As we navigate this delicate terrain, it's essential for men to recognize their role in shaping these conversations. We must distinguish between appreciation of a woman's autonomy and the ingrained objectification embedded in our views. It's about re-educating ourselves, reshaping our perceptions, and actively choosing to support women's rights to make choices about their bodies without added sexualization.

"90% Admiration, 10% Perversion" is not just a catchy title—it's a reflection of society's current state in dealing with changes to body norms. Let's work towards making it 100% admiration by understanding and respecting the personal and empowering nature of going braless. It's high time that society evolves to see women as more than just their bodies, but as individuals making choices for their comfort and health.
